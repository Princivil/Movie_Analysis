## Key Findings by Chapter
- **Directors & Budget Efficiency:** Directors can influence quality, but budget is a weak predictor of success.  
- **Critical vs Popularity:** High ratings don’t guarantee high revenue (e.g., History excels critically but not financially).  
- **Platform Strategies:** Disney+ leans on Animation for revenue; Netflix, Hulu, and Prime emphasize Documentaries or niche genres for ratings.  
- **Golden & Iconic Films:** Only ~24% of top-rated classics are on streaming; Netflix leads in collection size, Disney+ in profitability.  
- **Revenue vs Quantity:** Larger catalogs don’t always yield higher revenue — curated high-impact films matter more.  
- **Genre Momentum:** Crime and TV Movies show resilience; traditional genres like Sci-Fi and Fantasy are trending downward.  
- **Runtime & Budget:** Budgets rise after 90 minutes and peak in 120–150 min, but runtime alone doesn’t drive investment.  
- **Commercial vs Critical Success:** Animation delivers the strongest commercial ROI, while History/War stand out critically.  
- **Audience Targeting:** Age ratings alone don’t drive runtime, ratings, or ROI — but certain **age × genre** combinations (e.g., 13+ Romance, Horror, Documentaries) outperform expectations.

## Conclusion
The movie streaming market is a complex ecosystem where creative, commercial, and strategic factors intersect.  
- **Budgets and ratings alone are poor predictors of success.**  
- **ROI depends on context-specific choices** such as the right genre-age combinations and platform positioning.  
- Platforms should **balance high-revenue blockbusters with efficient, niche content** to maximize engagement and profitability.  

By strategically curating diverse portfolios and leveraging proven age–genre ROI combinations, streaming platforms can maintain resilience and secure competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded industry.
